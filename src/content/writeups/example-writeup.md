# Example CTF Write-up: Web Challenge

## Challenge Overview
This write-up details the solution to a web security challenge from a recent CTF competition. The challenge involved identifying and exploiting multiple vulnerabilities in a web application.

## Initial Reconnaissance
First, I performed a basic reconnaissance of the web application:

```bash
curl -I https://challenge.example.com
```

The response headers revealed some interesting information about the server configuration.

## Vulnerability Discovery
The application had several security issues:

1. SQL Injection in the login form
2. XSS vulnerability in the user profile page
3. Insecure direct object references

## Exploitation
### SQL Injection
The login form was vulnerable to SQL injection. Here's the payload I used:

```sql
admin' OR '1'='1' --
```

### XSS Exploit
The user profile page didn't properly sanitize user input:

```javascript
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

## Solution
After identifying the vulnerabilities, I was able to:

1. Bypass authentication using SQL injection
2. Steal session cookies via XSS
3. Access the admin panel using the stolen credentials

## Lessons Learned
This challenge reinforced several important security concepts:

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly update and patch web applications

## Conclusion
This write-up demonstrates the importance of thorough security testing and the potential impact of common web vulnerabilities.
