# Example CTF Write-up: Web Challenge

A detailed walkthrough of solving a web security challenge from a recent CTF competition.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge involved a web application with several vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to a protected area.

## Exploitation Steps

1. Initial reconnaissance revealed a potential SQL injection vulnerability
2. Using a combination of XSS and SQL injection techniques, we were able to bypass authentication
3. The final flag was obtained by accessing admin functionality

## Key Techniques Used

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Authentication Bypass
- Session Hijacking

## Tools

- Burp Suite
- SQLmap
- Custom Python scripts

## Conclusion

This challenge demonstrated how combining multiple vulnerabilities can lead to a complete compromise of a web application.
